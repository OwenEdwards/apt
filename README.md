A Web-Based Media Player Accessibility Comparison Table

Why APT? It's short and APT stands for Accessible Player Table. The repository is a home for the web-based media player accessibility comparison table.

See http://kensgists.github.io/apt/ for the details and guidance on contributing evaluations of players.

**Note:** This project will begin taking pull requests as soon as the [old, Google Sheets version](http://go.osu.edu/player-matrix) of the player table is aligned with this one.
